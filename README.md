College Github account 
ReadME repository
I set up a GitHub repository named username.github.io with a README file, installed GitHub Desktop, logged in, and cloned the repository to my local machine. After editing the README with my details, I committed and pushed my changes back to GitHub, and took screenshots of the repository and cloned folder for submission.
