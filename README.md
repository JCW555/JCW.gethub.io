College Github account 
ReadME repository
I set up a GitHub repository, created an account and a new repository named username.github.io, adding a README file. Install GitHub Desktop, log in, clone the repository to your local machine, edit the README with your details, and then commit and push your changes back to GitHub. Finally, take screenshots of both your GitHub repository and the cloned folder for submission.
